# Create an organization  
  
To create an organization:  
  
Log in to your Meta account and navigate to the developer dashboard.  
Open the Select Organization menu and then select Create.   
Choose the Name of the organization with care, as this name is associated with any app you distribute in the Meta Quest Store.  
Select Submit.  
Review the Developer Non-Disclosure Agreement, select I Agree, and then select Submit. The My Apps page loads.  
On the My Apps page, create your organizationâ€™s first app. For more information, see Create Apps and Release Channels.
